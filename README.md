# Foundations-of-Muskuloskeletal-Simulations-

This guide is for beginners in biomechanics who know how to code but are learning how to model the human body and simulate its movement. Instead of comparing simulation tools directly, we will first build the foundations of what musculoskeletal modeling involves and then explore how different tools approach different aspects of the problem.

It's worth visiting [Anatomy Lab](https://anatomy-lab.com/) where they host a muscle library for detailed 3D models. You can also learn more about the human anatomy here!

#### What Is Musculoskeletal Modeling?

It's about simulating how the body moves as a whole system controlled by muscles. To model this, we need to represent:
  - Bones — rigid bodies that form the skeleton
  - Joints — where bones connect 
  - Muscles and Tendons — soft tissues that generate force and cause movement

Unlike motors in robots, muscles are not direct actuators. They have delays, nonlinear force-length and force-velocity properties, and compliance due to tendons.

A realistic simulation must include:
- Excitation: the neural input to the muscle
- Activation dynamics: how the muscle responds over time
- Force generation: how the muscle’s length and velocity affect its ability to produce force
- Transmission: how that force moves the joint through tendons

This makes musculoskeletal models more complex than mechanical linkages or robot arms.

#### What Makes a Simulator Suitable for Musculoskeletal Modeling?

To simulate realistic human or animal movement, the simulator should support:

- Physiological muscle models (e.g., Hill-type)
- Realistic joints with anatomical constraints
- Input via neural commands (excitation or activation)
- Analysis tools for inverse kinematics/dynamics
- Custom controllers or policies for learning or coordination

Each simulator we look at supports a different subset of these. Let’s now build the mindset you need to interpret and use them correctly.
